## Nerd's thinking
### Gains:
- It was a great usage for Redux and React-Saga 
- I learned to use React-Saga for dealing with API requests and errors from it 


### Pains:
- A default marker was created when there was no data received for the React Google Map, which was annoying to remove 
- Too frequent reloading the page would cause the API freezed for couple of seconds 

## Languages:
- React 
- React-Redux 
- React-Saga 
- React-Toastify 
- Material-ui 
- Google-maps-react 
- React-Highcharts
